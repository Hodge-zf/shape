#Inheritance lab - Two-Dimensional Shapes
**Goals**
* Write 5 instantiable classes: `Circle`, `Ellipse`, `Rectangle`, `Square`, `RightTriangle`
* Each will inherit from a proper chain of parent classes until you reach the Super, `TwoDimensionalShape`
* Each class will compute `area` and `perimeter`/`circumference` via **proper** inheritance
* Provide a readable `toString` method detailing properties
* Provide an `equals` method to compare area value of two shapes
* Write a driver that demonstrates use of polymorphism by comparing object instances.
  * At least once of each instantiable class
